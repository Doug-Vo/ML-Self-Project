# Machine Learning Projects

This repository is a collection of machine learning projects and experiments. The goal is to explore various datasets from different online sources and build predictive models.

Current working space

## Summer 2025 (old)

The repository is organized into two primary directories, based on the development environment and platform where the work was conducted:

-   `Kaggle/`: This directory contains all projects, notebooks, and scripts that were developed using datasets from Kaggle. Each sub-folder within `/Kaggle` corresponds to a specific Kaggle dataset or competition.

-   `Google_Colab/`: This directory contains all notebooks developed using Google Colab. These projects often utilize datasets from various sources (e.g., UCI Machine Learning Repository, data.world, etc.) and utilize the cloud-based GPU resources provided by Colab.
